A learning repository containing my completed learning projects

Learning-Quiz
First Phython learning program.

A quick and easy sports related quiz to test inputs and coding in order to create a fully functioning, yet simple, quiz/program.

Built using IDLE(python 3.14)

Outcome:
This was a great way to take learned theory and put it into practice. Lots of additional learning garnered from carrying out this task, albeit simple, yet important to cement the learning.
As I continue to learn I will look to implement new code which will allow for obvious attempts at correct answers to be considered as correct. Currently incorrect grammar or typing errors will lead to an incorrect answer response. This can be corrected via the use of specialized libraries


File permissions in Linux project

A text based file containing both text based and visual descriptions of how I check, change and maintain permissions within an organisations network. This was completed using Linux commands within the bash shell
